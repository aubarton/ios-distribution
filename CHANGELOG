Splitforce Library

Version 0.4.2 Revisions
=======================
 - Library support for Variant Validation Scripting (VVS), coming soon to Splitforce.com website.
 - VVS Supported values (set on the global object):
    - UIIdiom, valid values "pad" or "phone"
    - frameworkVersion
    - model
    - deviceName

Version 0.4.1 Revisions
=======================
 - Localisations now fallback to Major-locale matches prior to most-recently used matches.  i.e. if a user first sets their device to Chinese and then to British-English, then we will match US-english localisations before Chinese localisations when there is no en-GB localisation included.
 - Results on Splitforce.com are split based on the combination of locales picked for each component in a variation.

Version 0.4 Revisions
=====================

 - Cohort Identification
  - Callback to indicate to user code which cohort this user is in.  Can be used to hook in third party & bespoke analytics platforms.
  - Callback to allow user code to modify the cohort - this is useful for testing by enabling the developer to specify which exact
    variations to execute each time.
 - Variation Choice is now done at Initialisation time (previously this was done on demand)
 - Default SFVariations are created if the experiment used the default block.  The reserved variation name __sf_default is used for defaults.
 - Sample Rate is deprecated - use the splitforce.com website to configure experiment coverage.
 - Introduced CHANGELOG file to present changes to the framework.
 - Added support for rolling out a winner (and rollback)
